# Instanews README

Project designing an HTML/CSS website that uses the jQuery ajax method to populate the homepage with information from the New York Times Top Stories API. 

## Features

Used the jQuery AJAX method to get the data from the New York Times API. Learned how to iterate through multiple objects using the .each function.

Incorporated CSS transitions to glide the header smoothly to the top, and to glide the images while re-sizing the browser. 

## Contributing

Please feel free to submit an issue or pull request. The website is simple enough to not require a build process, just open index.html in a browser.
